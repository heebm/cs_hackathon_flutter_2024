# CS Hackathon 2024 - Exercise 1
In this exercise, we'll try to use Stateless widgets, both Basic and Layout widgets.

**It is recommended to use online sources!**

## Tasks
In `lib/main_screen.dart`, add the necessary code such that:

* A _rectangle button_ is added below the text.
* The button should contain the _text_ "My Button".
* Both the text and the button are _centered_ (middle of the screen).

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
