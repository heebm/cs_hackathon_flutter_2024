# CS Hackathon 2024 - Exercise 2
In this exercise, we'll try to use different types of widgets to fix our little game.

**It is recommended to use online sources!**

## Tasks
In `lib/egg_screen.dart`, add the necessary code such that:

* **Our game is fixed**. That is: Whenever the egg is tapped, the text which displays its current count and the image should reflect the actual `_count` value.
* Increase the font size for the `_count` label.
* Make the `_count` label **bold**.

## Useful Information
* Check out Flutter's [widget catalog](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets), mainly the "Basics" and "Layout" categories.
* Investigate the TextStyle constructor with **Ctrl + Space**.
* If you want to change the type of an existing widget, try to press **Alt + Enter** while your cursor is on the widget's name, and see what Studio allows you to do easily.
